## Notes
*Use this space to record your findings and deductions...*

Location of the crime is still unknown - the room must have been empty when it happened...
 
 Found the Brass Bell on the mansion and the Steel Ruler on the Storage, after checking the stockroom i conclude the crime happened there so the Crystal Vase should be the used weapon,finally i found the shopkeeper at the park and the baker at the market , so the murderer in this case has to be the Florist.
